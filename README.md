GDAX API-based C# desktop client

The primary goal for this project is just to create a basic API-based client that should be able to remain connected during those times when the web site goes down, but the API is still up and running. Further enhancements may be added. I'm flexible about the direction it goes.

Coinbase/GDAX API information can be found at https://docs.gdax.com

There's an APIData.xml file in the Model directory where you can insert your API credentials. Make sure you clear these out or ignore the file before committing!
